Otu1, Otu2 and Otu3 are in phylum Bacteroidetes.

Genus bootstrap values are 0.36, 0.46 and 0.55.

At this time, the top identities according to NCBI
BLAST are Otu1 95%, Otu2 94% and Otu3 92%. For Otu1, the top hit
was Duncaniella freteri strain TLL-A3. For the other two, the top hit
was Muribaculum intestinale strain YL27. The latter identities are <95%
so we cannot identify a genus for them. This may change as new sequences 
are added to the 16S database.
