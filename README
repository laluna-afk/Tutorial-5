This repository is created to store information involved in tutorial 5 of ECES450/650 at Drexel University in Spring of 2022.
NOTE: While the repository has all the information used and generated, the outputs of the 'run.bash' and 'run_mock.bash' files
  are only available as zipped folders, due to GitHub's file size limitations. The folders can either be unzipped, or the 
  scripts mentioned above can be run in order to recreate the information in a format that allows for recreation of our results

The tutorial is a usearch tutorial, obtained at https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/upp_tut_misop.html

To emulate results in /misop/exercises/ex*_answers.txt, the user must first run 'run.bash' and 'run_mock.bash' in the /scripts/
  folder. Further, the usearch installed *must* be of version 10.X.XXX, which is a full version behind what is currently most up
  to date.
With usearch v10 installed and referenced as $usearch in a local environment, the user can emulate the results in 
  /exercises/ex*_answers.txt by running the /exercises/ex*.bash files.

The slides of what we presented is available in Tutorial 5.pptx, and all data used and generated in the course of this tutorial 
are available in the various subfolders in this repository
