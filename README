This repository is created to store information involved in tutorial 5 of ECES450/650 at Drexel University in Spring of 2022.
NOTE: The repository is missing some information, as github caps upload size to 25MB, and the files generated by 'run.bash' and
  'run_mock.bash' are around 55 MB. However, the missing folders/information can be generated by running those bash files as 
  they are right now.

The tutorial is a usearch tutorial, obtained at https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/upp_tut_misop.html

To emulate results in /misop/exercises/ex*_answers.txt, the user must first run 'run.bash' and 'run_mock.bash' in the /scripts/
  folder. Further, the usearch installed *must* be of version 10.X.XXX, which is a full version behind what is currently most up
  to date.
With usearch v10 installed and referenced as $usearch in a local environment, the user can emulate the results in 
  /exercises/ex*_answers.txt by running the /exercises/ex*.bash files.

The slides of what we presented is available in Tutorial 5.pptx, and all data used and generated in the course of this tutorial are
  available in the various subfolders in this repository
