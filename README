This repository is created to store information involved in tutorial 5 of ECES450/650 at Drexel University in Spring of 2022.

The tutorial is a usearch tutorial, obtained at https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/upp_tut_misop.html

To emulate results in /misop/exercises/ex*_answers.txt, the user must first run 'run.bash' and 'run_mock.bash' in the /misop/scripts/ folder.
Further, the usearch installed *must* be of version 10.X.XXX, which is a full version behind what is currently most up to date.
With usearch v10 installed and referenced as $usearch in a local environment, the user can emulate the results in /misop/exercises/ex*_answers.txt
by running the  /misop/exercises/ex*.bash files.

The slides of what we presented is available in Tutorial 5.pptx, and all data used and generated in the course of this tutorial are available in the various /misop/ subfolders.
